# Development Guide

## Quick Start

For fast development with hot-reload:

```bash
npm run dev:watch
```

This will:
- Start Electron with development flags
- Watch for changes in `.js`, `.html`, and `.css` files  
- Automatically restart the app when files change
- Open DevTools automatically (with suppressed Autofill warnings)
- Show file change notifications in terminal

## Development Commands

- `npm start` - Start the app normally
- `npm run dev` - Start app in development mode with DevTools
- `npm run dev:watch` - Start with nodemon watching for file changes

## Development Features

- **Hot Reload**: Files are watched and app automatically reloads on changes
- **DevTools**: Chrome DevTools are automatically opened in dev mode
- **Clean Console**: Autofill warnings are suppressed for cleaner debugging
- **File Watching**: Changes to `index.html` and `app.js` trigger immediate reload
- **Change Notifications**: Terminal shows which file triggered the reload
- **Memory Management**: File watchers are properly cleaned up on app exit

## File Structure

```

â”œâ”€â”€ main.js                    # Electron main process with IPC handlers
â”œâ”€â”€ preload.js                 # Secure IPC bridge for renderer communication
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html                 # Application UI with tabbed interface
â”œâ”€â”€ app.js                     # Frontend logic (Phases 2, 3, 3.5)

## Making Changes

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev:watch`
2. Edit any file (`index.html`, `app.js`, `main.js`)
3. Save the file
4. App automatically reloads with your changes

## Debugging

- DevTools are automatically opened in development mode
- Check the Console tab for application logs (Autofill warnings suppressed)
- Use `console.log()` for debugging in `app.js`
- Main process logs appear in the terminal where you ran the command
- File change events are logged with `ðŸ”„` emoji for easy identification

## Tips

- Keep the terminal open to see main process logs and nodemon restart messages
- Use the DevTools Console for frontend debugging (cleaner output with suppressed warnings)
- Changes to `main.js` require a full restart (nodemon handles this automatically)
- Changes to `index.html` and `app.js` trigger fast in-window reloads
- Look for `ðŸ”„ File changed: filename, reloading...` messages to confirm hot-reload is working

## Troubleshooting

- **Autofill warnings**: These are harmless DevTools internal warnings that don't affect functionality
- **UnhandledPromiseRejection**: Added proper error handling in both main and renderer processes
- **Hot-reload issues**: Restart with `npm run dev:watch`
- **Nodemon issues**: Try `npm install nodemon` to ensure it's properly installed
- **IPC errors**: Fixed with `webSecurity: false` in development mode
