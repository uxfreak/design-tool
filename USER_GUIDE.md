## Component Discovery System

### How It Works

The Design Tool automatically discovers React components in your project using intelligent file scanning:

1. **File Scanning**: Scans all JavaScript/TypeScript files in the project
2. **AST Parsing**: Uses Abstract Syntax Tree parsing to identify React components
3. **Variant Detection**: Finds components with custom variant definitions
4. **Live Updates**: Updates component library when files change

### Supported Component Patterns

**Functional Components**:
```javascript
function Button({ variant, children }) {
  return <button className={variant}>{children}</button>;
}

Button.variants = [
  { name: 'Primary', props: { variant: 'primary' } },
  { name: 'Secondary', props: { variant: 'secondary' } }
];

export default Button;
```

**Class Components**:
```javascript
class Card extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div className="card">{this.props.children}</div>;
  }
}

Card.variants = [
  { name: 'Default', props: {} },
  { name: 'Elevated', props: { elevation: true } }
];
```

**Component Metadata**:
- Component name and file location
- Variant definitions with props
- Dependencies and imports
- Documentation comments

### Live Component Previews

Components are rendered live using the running development server:
- Real-time updates when code changes
- Actual styling and behavior
- Interactive component states
- Error handling for broken components

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Terminal Not Working**:
- Ensure node-pty is rebuilt for your Electron version
- Check terminal permissions in system settings
- Restart application to reset PTY processes

**Server Won't Start**:
- Check if ports are available (3000, 3001, 3002+)
- Verify npm/yarn is installed and accessible
- Check project dependencies are installed correctly
- Review server logs in terminal for specific errors

**Component Discovery Not Working**:
- Ensure components follow supported patterns
- Check that variant definitions are properly formatted
- Verify file permissions in project directory
- Restart project to refresh component scanning

**Projects Won't Create**:
- Verify write permissions in projects directory
- Check internet connection for dependency downloads
- Ensure npm/yarn is installed and in PATH
- Try creating project manually to isolate issues

### Debug Mode

**Enable Debug Logging**:
1. Open Settings ‚Üí Advanced
